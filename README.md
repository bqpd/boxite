Boxite
--------
Boxite lets your team build a portfolio, process, or documentation site as part of your work, instead of as a final (and often-skipped) step.

Boxite separates a websiteâ€™s hosting and editing so that you can host anywhere, make changes in a shared folder (such as Dropbox), and see your site instantly update.

Visit the [project site](http://box.obio.me) for details and documentation.
